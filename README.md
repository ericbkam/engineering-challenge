I looked extensively through online tutorials and resources, but this is what I have so far for the backend! With a bit more guidance on what exactly the backend here (and in general) is supposed to implement, I could add anything needed!

# Carta Engineering Challenge
The backend and frontend have been initialized with starter code for Flask and React to help you get started.

## Running the Applications
### Backend
Be sure you have python and the flask module installed. Then, run:

    $ env FLASK_APP=api.py flask run

### Frontend
Be sure you have a recent version of nodejs installed (12 or 13). Then, run:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

## Special Instructions
Write anything else we need to do to run your application here.
